## Struggles
My biggest struggle for this assignment was the api routes, I had to get help from my project 3 partners with it, other than that a large struggle for me was why my localhost 3001 wasn't working, it ended up being i already had something running on localhost:3001, since then i've learned how to kill a port but as a fix i decided to use localhost 4001
